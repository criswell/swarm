It should be known that this is the developmental base of swarm. As such,
nothing should be considered sacred here. Any interface, method, module,
algorithm, tehcnique, comment, or any other chunk of code is free game
for re-writing. Persons contributing to this project should know this and
be aware that the only reasons *not* to rewrite/tinker with the code base
is when the rewrite/tinker isn't technically sound or otherwise grants no
benefit over the existing code.

In many cases with Free and Open Source software this probably should go
without saying, but I wanted to state this specifically so that persons
knowing that code herein is *not* sacred, and that rewrites are
encouraged.

That being said, once we reach a certain state and have something stable,
if we ever do change API or database schemas, we need to allow for some
sort of sane deprecation and migration.
