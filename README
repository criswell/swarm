NOTE:

Currently this project WILL NOT RUN.

It had previously depended on sqlite, however, it has become apparent that it
should use a more generalized interface to a document-oriented DB backend
(such as CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.). E.g., it needs something like SQLAlchemy,
but for document-oriented databases.

Unfortunately, right now, no such thing seems to exist (as near as I can
tell). So, I'm being forced to write it.

So, swarm is on hold until the project doChemistry,
https://bitbucket.org/criswell/dochemistry , is more useable.

Stay tuned (or help out with doChemistry).
